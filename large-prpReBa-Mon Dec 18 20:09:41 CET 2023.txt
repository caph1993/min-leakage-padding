Reimplementation of all the algorithms using n x m sparse matrices.

To run from command line, just

    python this_file.py COMMAND

COMMAND should be one of:
        large_all:                 run all algorithms      in nodeJS dataset
        medium_all:                run all algorithms      in subset of nodeJS dataset
        large_PopReBa:             run PopReBa in nodeJS dataset
        large_PopRe:               run PopRe      in nodeJS dataset
        medium_PopSh:              run PopSh    in subset of nodeJS dataset
        
        etc. (see the dictionary called "the_solvers" for all solvers, and function cli for more commands)
